# Credit Card Analysis & Customer Insights - Power BI Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **credit card usage patterns** and **customer demographics** using SQL and Power BI.  
The goal is to uncover trends in spending, customer behavior, and financial insights to assist in data-driven decision-making.  

## 📊 Dataset Description  
The project uses two datasets:  

1. **Credit Card Transactions**  
   - Includes details like card category, annual fees, transaction amounts, credit limits, and utilization ratios.  
2. **Customer Demographics**  
   - Contains age, gender, marital status, job type, income, and satisfaction scores.  

## 🛠️ Data Processing  
The data was prepared in two ways:  
1. **SQL Method**  
   - A SQL script was used to create tables (`cc_detail` and `cust_detail`) and import data from CSV files.  
   - The SQL query structures and loads the data efficiently.  

2. **Direct Import in Power BI**  
   - The Excel files were loaded as text into Power BI.  
   - Data transformations were performed using Power Query.
